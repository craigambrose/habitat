        You can help by trying out <em>Habitat</em> and telling us what you think. 
    %p
      New features are being added each week. You can't currently go all the way through
      the design of your forest garden, but the bits that already exist still help you
      get along the path.
    %p
      Some parts of <em>Habitat</em> will eventually be for paying users, to keep
      this project running, but anyone who actively tests the project now will get free
      lifetime membership.
    %p
      Keep an eye out at the bottom of each page for upcoming features which look like this:
    = todo('this is an new feature idea')
